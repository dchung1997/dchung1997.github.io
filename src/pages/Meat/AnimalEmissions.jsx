                        The year is 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic is nearing its
                        peak. As the world continues to recover from disruptions
                        to the global economy. A new record is set as global
                        greenhouse emissions increase to 53.8 (Gt CO2eq). While
                        global emissions continue to rise, no country is close
                        to reaching the 1.5°C limit set up by the Paris Climate
                        Agreement in 2015.

                        Under the Climate Paris Accords 195 of the 196 nation
                        states represented in the UN came to an agreement of
                        limiting global emissions to just under 1.5°C. An
                        ambitious target set by the nations around the world.
                        However, as of 2024 no major country has come close to
                        reaching this target. It's estimated that in order for
                        there to be a 67% chance of staying under the 1.5°C
                        limit. Total global emissions from 2020-2100 would need
                        to stay under 500 billion tons of CO2 eq. (Gt CO2eq.) As
                        of 2024 most scientists predict that we will pass this
                        metric within the next 5 years.

                        Similarly for there to be a 50% chance of staying under
                        the 1.5°C limit set by the accords, global emissions
                        would need to stay under 705 billion tons of CO2
                        equivalent emissions. Estimates today by scientists put
                        us at breaking this limit by the mid 2030s.

                        As it currently stands the Meat & Dairy Industry is set
                        to produce approximately 811 billion tons of emissions
                        between 2020 and 2100. With Meat and Dairy accounting
                        for around 14.5% of all emissions and more than half of
                        all global food emissions. Meat and Dairy Emissions
                        alone set up a future where the Paris Climate Accords
                        are never met.

                        are out of reach.

                        would only be 49 Gt remaining for non-food based
                        emissions. In 2022 global energy emissions alone reached
                        a new high of 53.8 Gt. As it currently stands breaking
                        2.0°C could happen as early as the 2040s.

                        Is it really possible to stay under the 1.5°C limit set
                        by the Paris Climate Accord? By the mid 21st century we
                        could use up the remaining 1816 Gts of our carbon budget
                        left for a 50% chance to stay under 2.0°C. As it stands
                        currently the world is getting hotter at an
                        unsustainable rate. Without any change to current
                        emission rates the average world temperature could
                        easily surpace 3-4°C by the year 2100.
