                        Globally, livestock and animals are responsible for 37%
                        of all human-caused methane emissions and 65% of all
                        agriculturally related nitrogen emissions. Two of the
                        most significant causes of non-CO2 greenhouse emissions
                        are methane and nitrogren emissions. Those that tended
                        to do with the practice of farming animals and livestock
                        along with the feeding of livestock. These practices
                        alone contribute more than enough to surpass the limits
                        required by the Paris Accords of increasing the average
                        global temperature by 1.5ÂºC. Reducing these emissions is
                        a crucial step towards to greener and cleaner world.
                        But, the issues regarding this are complex.

                      In 2023 around 2.33 billion people around the world faced
                      moderate to severe food insecurity. While most countries
                      are still struggling to deal with food security in some
                      form, in developing regions its impacts are proving to be
                      much worse. In this series, we'll be looking at these
                      issues and the problems many governments today are facing.
                      Along with what they are doing and could do given
                      additional funding.
